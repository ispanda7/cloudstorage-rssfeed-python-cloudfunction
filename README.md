# cloud-storage-rssfeed-python

This infraestructure create an application that generates a RSS Feed file each time that a file is uploaded into a bucket, there‚Äôs another function that shows the file generated in JSON.

If you are interested in seeing the blog regarding this project I‚Äôm glad to share it! in [Medium](https://medium.com/stash-media/troubleshooting-terraform-on-a-serverless-world-b4c2a6019f54). 
I‚Äôm going to cover the problems I had during the implementation and the decision I made to fix those.

## Before you begin

### Google SDK

It‚Äôs important to make sure that Cloud SDK is authorized to access your data and services.

```
gcloud auth login
```

On the new browser tab that opens by running the command, choose an account that has the Editor or Owner role in the Google Cloud project.

### Configuring the Google Provider

If you don‚Äôt specify the credentials in the file we can supply the key to Terraform using the environment variable setting the value to the location of the file. If you are in Windows use set instead of export.

```
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON={{path}}
```

If you have any problems with this step check this [Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/8493)

## Getting started

### Usage

We initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.

```
terraform init
```

Run the following command that scans the current directory for the `.tf` files and applies the changes appropriately.

```
terraform apply
```
